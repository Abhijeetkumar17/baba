// A jump table, also known as a branch table or a dispatch table,
//  is a data structure used in computer programming to implement a multiway branch.
//  Itâ€™s an array of pointers to the memory addresses of different sections of code,
//  where each pointer corresponds to a specific value or range of values that
//  the program can branch to based on the value of a variable or expression.

// Jump tables are often used to implement switch statements in low-level languages like C and C++.
//  When the switch statement is executed,
//  the program calculates the index of the appropriate case label in the 
// jump table based on the value of the expression or variable being evaluated and then
//  jumps directly to that memory address to
//  execute the statements associated with that case label.
